###################################################
The Full Monty scientific Python installers for OSX
###################################################

The Full Monty installers give you the whole scientific Python stack in one
easy-to-swallow installer package for OSX.

We recommend you use these installers with Python from the `Python.org`_
installers.  First install Python.org Python, then download and install from
the disk images here.

You can also use these disk images to install on homebrew_ and macports_ - see
the README file on the disk images for instructions.

Please don't use the Python that comes with OSX, it will cause you `no end of
problems <which python_>`_ with scientific Python packages.

*********************************************
Why would I use your installer instead of ...
*********************************************

You might like to use these installers if you want a double click installer
that will install the standard scientific Python packages in one go.

The Full Monty installer uses the `pip`_ tool to do the main work of
installing the component Python packages.  Pip is the standard package
installer for Python, `recommended <pypa recommended_>`_ by the `Python
packaging authority`_.  The Full Monty will also install Pip for you, if you
don't have it (it comes by default with Python >= 3.4).

You can always do something very similar to this installer using the pip
command line, but the installer means you can download a single file that
contains a set of packages that are known to work together.

How do we know they work together?  Because we test them automatically using
the `Travis public testing service <travis-ci_>`_ - see `wheels2dmg on
travis-ci`_.

Anyone is welcome to come help maintain these installers.  We build them with
the `wheels2dmg`_ package, available on Github, and use the standard `Python
Packaging Authority`_ binary package format, `wheels`_.

Other free installers installer bundles that you might consider are:

* `Anaconda`_ : maintained and supported by `Continuum analytics`_ and using
  an alternative installer and binary format called `conda`_.
* `Enthought Canopy`_ : maintained and supported by `Enthought`_.

*****************************
What packages do you install?
*****************************

The list of packages comes from the `wheels2dmg travis configuration`_:

The packages are:

* numpy_;
* scipy_;
* matplotlib_;
* `ipython`_ (including the IPython notebook);
* pandas_;
* numexpr_;
* sympy_.

If you need anything else, you can usually install it with pip.  Say you want
the `scikit-learn`_ machine learning package.  First run the installer, then
open Terminal.app and run::

    pip install scikit-learn

And now for the moment you've been waiting for

**********
Installing
**********

It is the usual OSX install routine:

* Download the disk image for the Python that you are using;
* Double click on the disk image to mount it;
* Right click and select open to open the ``.pkg`` installer file on the disk
  image;
* Say yes to a mountain of scientific Python quality.
