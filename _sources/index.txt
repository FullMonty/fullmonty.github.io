The Full Monty scientific Python installers for OSX
###################################################

The full Monty installers give you the whole scientific Python stack in one
easy-to-swallow installer package for OSX.

We recommend you use these installers with Python from the `Python.org`_
installers.  First install Python.org Python, then download and install from
the disk images here.

You can also use these disk images to install on homebrew_ and macports_ - see
the README file on the disk images for instructions.

Please don't use the Python that comes with OSX, it will cause you `no end of
problems <which python_>`_ with scientific Python packages.

*********************************************
Why would I use your installer instead of ...
*********************************************

You might like to use these installers if you want a double click installer
that will install the standard scientific Python packages in one go.

These installers use the `pip`_ tool to do this.  Pip is standard installer
for Python, `recommended <pypa recommended_>`_ by the `Python packaging
authority`_.  The installers will also install Pip for you, if you don't have
it (it comes by default with Python >= 3.4).

You can always do something very similar to this installer using the pip
command line, but the installer means you can download a single file that
contains a set of packages that are known to work together.

How do we know they work together?  Because we test them automatically using
the `Travis public testing service <travis-ci_>`_ - see `wheels2dmg on
travis-ci`_.

Anyone is welcome to come help maintain these installers.  We build them with
the `wheels2dmg`_ package, available on Github, and use the standard `Python
Packaging Authority`_ binary package format, `wheels`_.
